  "readme": "# DirectMail\n\nSendmail alternative to send e-mails directly to recipients without a relaying service.\n\n### Support DirectMail development\n\n[![Donate to author](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_SM.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DB26KWR2BQX5W)\n\nIf you want to support with Bitcoins then my wallet address is `15Z8ADxhssKUiwP3jbbqJwA21744KMCfTM`\n\n## Usage\n\n### Setup\n\nRequire *directmail* object\n\n    var createDirectmail = require(\"directmail\"),\n        directmail = createDirectmail(options);\n\nWhere\n\n  * **options** is an optional options object with the following properties\n    * *debug* - if set to true, prints all traffic to console\n    * *name* - hostname to be used when introducing the client to the MX server\n\n### Send mail\n\nPush a message to the outgoing queue\n\n    directmail.send({\n        from: \"sender@example.com\",\n        recipients: [\"receiver1@example.com\", \"receiver2@example.com\"],\n        message: \"Subject: test\\r\\n\\r\\nHello world!\"\n    });\n\nWhere\n\n  * **from** (string) is the e-mail address of the sender\n  * **recipients** (array) is an array of recipient e-mails. Put all `to`, `cc` and `bcc` addresses here.\n  * **message** (string|buffer) is the RFC2822 message to be sent\n\n### Check queue length\n\nYou can check the count of unsent messages from the `.length` property of the directmail object\n\n    console.log(directmail.length); // nr of messages to be sent\n\nIf you try to send a message with multiple recipients then every unique recipient domain counts as a different message.\n\n## Issues\n\n*Directmail* is very inefficient as it queues all e-mails to be sent into memory. Additionally, if a message is not yet sent and the process is closed, all data about queued messages are lost. Thus *directmail* is only suitable for low throughput systems, like password remainders and such, where the message can be processed immediatelly. *Directmail* is not suitable for spamming.\n\nWhile not being 100% reliable (remember - if process exits, entire queue is lost), *directmail* can still handle sending errors, graylisting and such. If a message can not be sent, it is requeued and retried later.\n\n## License\n\n**MIT**\n",
