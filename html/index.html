        <h2>Web-Enabled DIS Maps with Websockets</h2>
        This shows DIS-enabled maps using two software packages: Google Maps, 
        and OpenLayers/OpenStreetMap.<p>

            <b>Google Maps</b> The terms of the Google Maps Javascript API license allows use of low-volume demos making use of 
            Google's map data for free. In this case the demo
        code is using of a personal Google Maps API key. Any real deployment
        would need an actual API key, and also require that you either have an internet
        connection or have a license to a commercial google earth server that 
        you can reach.<p>
         
            <b>OpenLayers/OpenStreetMap API</b> is a free and open source mapping implementation. 
        You can, with enough elbow grease, install your own free map server within
        your private, restricted network. This code is configured to use the 
        public and free OpenStreetMap servers. The implementation here is as of this 
        writing a little less polished than the google maps implementation, but
        the basics are the same. It does not yet handle popup info boxes for the 
        icons. There's some extra nonsense required to make that work, including
        jquery, bootstrap.js, and so on.<p></p>
       
        Both implementations talk to the same Jetty gateway/bridge. This bridge
        listens on the server's local network for DIS traffic on bcast port
        3000. It then forwards the DIS data, in binary form, to the web pages
        that have loaded content from the server, via a websocket. The web page
        decodes the DIS using the Open-DIS javascript library, and adds an icon
        to the page.<p>
            
        In both the Google Maps and OpenStreetMap implementations the HTML code
        is configured to use "ws://localhost:8282" as the location for the web
        page to contact the DIS websocket. If you are running the web page
        on a host that is not the same as the websocket server, you must modify
        this variable, called WEBSOCKET_URL in the Javascript HTML code.
