            Below you will find links and short descriptions of different parts of the documentation. If you are new to X3DOM, we recommend to read the <a href="gettingStarted/index.html">Getting Started</a> guide first.

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
            How do I get an X3DOM example up and running on my server? How can I test X3DOM applications on my local machine? And which version of X3DOM is best suited for my purposes?
            You will find answers to questions like this in the <a href="gettingStarted/index.html">Getting Started</a> guide.                        
            </p>

            <h2>Tutorials</h2>
            <p>
            The <a href="tutorials/index.html">X3DOM tutorials</a> are one of the best ways to get familiar with X3DOM and its most important Nodes.
            </p>

            <h2>Node API documentation</h2>
            <p>
            X3DOM, based on the ISO Standard X3D, is build around the concepts of individual <i>Nodes</i> inside a scenegraph. Node descriptions are placed in the HTML document (or included via the <code>inline</code> tag), as regular XML / HTML elements that have attributes, so-called <i>fields</i>. This way, you can build impressive 3D applications and, at the same time, write only a minimal amount of code, or even no code at all.
            The <a href="node/index.html">Node API documentation</a> provides a list of all nodes that are currently available in X3DOM, along with detailed field descriptions for each node.
            </p>
            
            
            <h2>Full API Documentation</h2>            
            <p>
            In contrast to the node API documentation, which provides you with information about the nodes and fields available in X3DOM, the <a href="full/index.html">Full API Documentation</a> goes one step further: Here, you will also find descriptions of X3DOM's JavaScript functions, many of them being primarily used internally.
            Such functions will enable you to perform advanced math operations inside your javascript code, and you'll also be able to perform more powerful interactions with the X3DOM graph. However, this requires some JavaScript knowledge, and you should first check that using the Node API does not do the job before you consider using the Full JavaScript API.
            </p>
            
            
            <h2>External Documentation Resources</h2><a name="X3DExternalDoc"></a>           
            <p>
            Since X3DOM is partly based on the ISO standard X3D, you may also consider X3D-related documentation resources.
            <ul>
                <li>The official <a href="http://www.web3d.org/files/specifications/19775-1/V3.2/Part01/concepts.html">X3D specification</a> contains an exhaustive list of all possible X3D nodes and detailed descriptions of the corresponding fields. The style of writing is, of course, very formal, though.</li>
                
                <li>If you're interested in learing X3D, the book <a href="http://x3dgraphics.com/">X3D: Extensible 3D Graphics for Web Authors</a> by Don Brutzman and Leonard Daly is definitely worth a look.
                
                <li>The <a href="http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/X3dResources.html">list of X3D resources</a> maintained by the Web3D consortium contains many more useful items, including books and authoring tools.                
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            
            <h2>Beyond this Documentation: Getting Help and Reporting Issues</h2>
            <p>
            If you have already browsed this online documentation resources, but still don't find what you're looking for, you might want to post a question to the X3DOM community.
            To do so, post your message to one of the following mailing lists:
            <ul>
                <li>The <code><a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/x3dom-users">x3dom-users</a></code> list deals with problems and questions related to using X3DOM nodes the right way.</li>
                <li>The <code><a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/x3dom-developers">x3dom-developers</a></code> list is meant for issues that are more closely related to the internals of X3DOM.</li>            
            </ul>
            If you think that you might have discovered a bug or something is not working as expected / described, first browse the <a href="https://github.com/x3dom/x3dom/issues">X3DOM GitHub page</a> for matching issues.
            If you don't discover the issue you ran into, feel free to create a new one.
