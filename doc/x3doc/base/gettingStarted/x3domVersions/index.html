            <br>
            <p>
            There are several versions of X3DOM available, so you might be wondering which one is best for your particular purposes.
            In general, we recommended to use the development version, since it always contains the latest features and fixes.
            However, after you have finished the main development work for your Web application, you might want to deploy it along with a downloaded snapshot of the latest
            version you used during development.
            You might, for some reasons, also be interested in using an older release, maybe because it contained some experimental features which you used in your application, which were removed in a later X3DOM version.
            </p>
            All X3DOM releases, including the development version, are each available as a package of one javascript file (e.g., <code>x3dom.js</code>),
            one css file (e.g., <code>x3dom.css</code>) and optionally one shockwave file (e.g., <code>x3dom.swf</code>, for versions with flash support) under <a href="http://x3dom.org/download/">http://x3dom.org/download/</a> for download:
            <ul>
                <li>Files for versions 1.0 to 1.2 are labeled with <code>x3dom-v</code>, followed by the version number (example: <a href="http://x3dom.org/download/x3dom-v1.1.js">http://x3dom.org/download/x3dom-v1.1.js</a>) and placed directly inside the folder.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Starting with version 1.3, the files <code>x3dom.js, x3dom.css, x3dom.swf</code> and a <code>.zip</code> archive containing the whole release are placed in a subfolder
                    which is named after the version number (example: <a href="http://x3dom.org/download/1.3/x3dom.js">http://x3dom.org/download/1.3/x3dom.js</a>).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Starting with version 1.3, there are some additional components available, which are not part of the HTML profile. Those components are, however, included in a variant of the <code>x3dom.js</code>
                    JavaScript file, which is entitled <code>x3dom-full.js</code>. If you require only one of the additional components, you might still decide to use the regular <code>x3dom.js</code> file and  additionally include only
                    the component you are interested in via the matching file in the <code>components</code> subfolder of the corresponding release (for example: <a href="http://x3dom.org/download/1.3/components/">http://x3dom.org/download/1.3/components/</a>).</li>
                <br>
                <li>The current development version is always located in the <code>dev</code> subfolder: <a href="http://x3dom.org/download/dev/x3dom.js">http://x3dom.org/download/dev/x3dom.js</a></li>
                <br>
            </ul>
            
            The following tags, which you can include in the head of your HTML page, use the current development version of X3DOM:
            <div class="codeSnippet">
                &lt;script src="http://www.x3dom.org/download/dev/x3dom.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                <br>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://www.x3dom.org/download/dev/x3dom.css"&gt;
            </div>
            
            To use the <i>X3DOM-Full</i> release of version 1.5, which includes the HTML profile plus all other components available, you would use the following lines:
            <div class="codeSnippet">
                &lt;script src="http://www.x3dom.org/download/1.5/x3dom-full.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                <br>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://www.x3dom.org/download/1.5/x3dom.css"&gt;
            </div>
            
            Finally, to use the regular X3DOM release of version 1.3 plus the additional <i>Geospatial</i> component and with additional flash support, you could write:
            <div class="codeSnippet">
                &lt;script src="http://www.x3dom.org/download/1.3/x3dom.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                <br>
                &lt;script src="http://www.x3dom.org/download/1.3/components/Geospatial.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;                
                <br>
                &lt;script src="http://www.x3dom.org/download/1.3/x3dom.swf"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                <br>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://www.x3dom.org/download/1.3/x3dom.css"&gt;
