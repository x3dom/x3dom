            Below you will find links and short descriptions of different parts of the documentation. If you are new to X3DOM, we recommend to read the <a href="gettingStarted/index.html">Getting Started</a> guide first.

            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>
            How do I get an X3DOM example up and running on my server? How can I test X3DOM applications on my local machine? And which version of X3DOM is best suited for my purposes?
            You will find answers to questions like this in the <a href="gettingStarted/index.html">Getting Started</a> guide.                        
            </p>

            <h3>Tutorials</h3>
            <p>
            The <a href="tutorials/index.html">X3DOM tutorials</a> are one of the best ways to get familiar with X3DOM and its most important Nodes.
            </p>
         
            
            <h3>Scene Author API documentation</h3>
            <p>
            X3DOM, based on the ISO Standard X3D, is build around the concepts of individual <i>Nodes</i> inside a scenegraph. Node descriptions are placed in the HTML document (or included via the <code>inline</code> tag), as regular XML / HTML elements that have attributes, so-called <i>fields</i>. This way, you can build impressive 3D applications and, at the same time, write only a minimal amount of code, or even no code at all.
            The <a href="author/index.html">Scene Author API documentation</a> provides a list of all nodes that are currently available in X3DOM, along with detailed field descriptions for each node.
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>Developer API Documentation</h3>
            <p>
            In contrast to the Scene Author API documentation, which provides you with information about the nodes and fields available in X3DOM, the <a href="developer/index.html">Developer API Documentation</a> goes one step further:
            Here, you will also find descriptions of X3DOM's internal JavaScript functions. This API is intended for developers of new nodes and components.            
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>External Documentation Resources</h3><a name="X3DExternalDoc"></a>
            <p>
            Since X3DOM is partly based on the ISO standard X3D, you may also consider X3D-related documentation resources.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The official <a href="http://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/19775-1/V3.3/Part01/Architecture.html">X3D specification</a> contains an exhaustive list of all possible X3D nodes and detailed descriptions of the corresponding fields. The style of writing is, of course, very formal, though.</li>
                
                <li>If you're interested in learning X3D, the book <a href="http://x3dgraphics.com/">X3D: Extensible 3D Graphics for Web Authors</a> by Don Brutzman and Leonard Daly is definitely worth a look.
                
                <li>The list of <a href="http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/X3dResources.html">X3D Resources</a> maintained by the Web3D Consortium contains many more useful items, including books and authoring tools.
            </ul>

            
            
            <h3>Beyond this Documentation: Getting Help and Reporting Issues</h3>
            <p>

                <li>The <code><a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/x3dom-developers">x3dom-developers</a></code> list is meant for issues that are more closely related to the internals of X3DOM.</li>            
            </ul>
            <p>
            If you think that you might have discovered a bug or something is not working as expected / described, first browse the <a href="https://github.com/x3dom/x3dom/issues">X3DOM GitHub page</a> for matching issues.
